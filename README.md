### Hey there! I'm Erick 👋

I'm very passionate about software development, and wish to get a degree in Computer Science!

* 4 years of programming experience in Python 🐍 and currently learning Rust 🦀!
* Striving to learn something new everyday!
* I'm part of the TurboCharge package manager development team, contributing with Windows support and making the manager faster! Check out TurboCharge [here](https://github.com/saint-dsnk/TurboCharge)!
* Unrelated to programming but I also enjoy playing basketball 🏀!
